# 🌐 omgawroo98.github.io – Developer Portfolio

Welcome to the source code of my personal developer portfolio, built with **React**, **Material UI**, and **i18n**. This site is designed to showcase who I am, what I build, and how I work — including project highlights, contact information, and a clear organizational workflow.

🧑‍🦯 This website was built with **WCAG 2.2 accessibility guidelines** in mind to ensure better usability and inclusion.

## 🧠 Workflow Philosophy

This project is structured using a **ticket-based system**. Each feature or bug is tied to a GitHub Issue with a unique ID (e.g., `TKT-001`). Commits reference these IDs to improve traceability:

```bash
feat: add theme toggle for dark mode [TKT-001]
fix: add missing translations to form labels [TKT-002]
```
